# GPTcoded-AIChat

I'm using ChatGPT to code an iOS AI Chat app. It is very basic in design and function. Current Features (updated 2024-05-24)

1. Chat with GPT-4o.
2. Basic conversation memory (verbatim conversation history).

This is part of a larger project to design an AI-powered pipeline that tests and debugs it's own code.

I am not a developer. All functionality is directly from ChatGPT, including formating, factoring, any structural choices, etc.

Code is tested in the "Swift Playgrounds" app on my iPad. I can use XCode, but I don't have a mac.
